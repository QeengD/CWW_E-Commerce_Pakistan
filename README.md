                          ProjectTitle:"E-commerceAnalytics:UnderstandingPakistaniMarket"
                          
ProjectOverview:
Welcome to Week Two of the Data Analysis Bootcamp! In this project, you will dive deep into a rich dataset containing detailed information about e-commerce orders in Pakistan. You will leverage your knowledge of descriptive statistics and inferential statistics using spreadsheets to uncover insights about the e-commerce market in Pakistan. This project will challenge you to explore and analyze real-world data to make informed decisions.

DatasetDescription:
You have access to a dataset with the following variables:
1. ItemID: Unique identifier for each product.
2.OrderStatus: The status of the order (Completed, Cancelled, Refund).
3. DateofOrder: The date when the order was placed.
4. SKU: Stock Keeping Unit, a unique identifier for each product.
5. Price: The price of the product.
6. Quantity: The quantity of the product ordered in each transaction.
7. GrandTotal: The total amount of the order.
8. Category: The category of the product (e.g., fashion, mobile, electronics, appliance).
9. PaymentMethod: The method of payment used (e.g., credit card, Easy-Paisa, Jazz-Cash, cash-on-delivery).
10. CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
    
ProjectTasks:
1. Data Exploration (2 Days): - Load the dataset into a spreadsheet tool (e.g., Excel or Google Sheets). - Examine the dataset's structure and missing values. - Create summary statistics for key variables (e.g., Price, Quantity, Grand Total) to understand their distributions.
2. Descriptive Statistics (2 Days): - Calculate descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for relevant columns. - Create visualizations (histograms, box plots, etc.) to explore the distribution of prices, quantities, and grand totals. - Identify trends or patterns in the data, such as which product categories are most popular or which payment methods are commonly used.
3. Inferential Statistics (3 Days): - Formulate hypotheses related to the dataset. For example: - Is there a significant difference in the average order total between different payment methods? - Do certain product categories have a higher likelihood of being canceled or refunded? - Perform appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-squared tests, etc.) to test your hypotheses. - Interpret the results and provide insights and recommendations based on your findings.
4. Data Cleanup and Presentation (1 Day): - Clean and format the dataset as needed for presentation. - Create a visually appealing and informative spreadsheet-based presentation summarizing your findings. - Include descriptive statistics tables, inferential statistics results, and visualizations in your presentation.
5. Final Presentation (1 Day): - Deliver a concise presentation in form of writing, summarizing your analysis, key findings, and any actionable recommendations for e-commerce businesses operating in Pakistan. - Be prepared to engage in discussions and answer questions about your analysis.
   
Deliverables:
- Excel spreadsheet containing all data and calculations.
- A presentation created in Excel or Google Sheets.
- A brief report summarizing your findings, insights, and recommendations.
This project will provide you with valuable experience in conducting data analysis using spreadsheet tools and help you gain insights into the e-commerce market in Pakistan. Happy analyzing!
